**NCBIminer** is a standalone application and run under **MATLAB Compiler runtime** (MCR,http://www.mathworks.cn/products/compiler/mcr/).It is used to download large number sequences for multiple taxa from GenBank using BLAST and GenBank annotation. This software was published in Ecography as software note (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.01055/abstract).

This software is quite easy to use. Using one or few sequnces of a specific gene, it can find and download all sequences from GenBank for user required taxomomic groups. DNA sample collection information can also be downloaded if user ask for. Results was stored in fasta format and can be filtered by sequence length  _etc_.
